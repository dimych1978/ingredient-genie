# Telemetron Sales App

This Next.js application, created with Firebase Studio, is designed to generate ingredient order lists for production. It allows users to specify machine types and quantities, and then uses a generative AI to create a detailed order list.

To get started, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser. The main application interface is located in `src/app/page.tsx`.
